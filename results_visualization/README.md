## Visualization
The code in this directory shows how to plot results in figures using [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/ggplot2.pdf).

### A list of figures

|Figure|Title of the figure|
|---|---|
|Figure 2|The associations of rs16969968 of UK Biobank participants (G1) with their own birthweight by their mothers’ (G0) smoking status during pregnancy|
|Figure 3|The associations of rs16969968 with 12 outcomes in UK Biobank participants (G1) by their mothers’ (G0) smoking status during pregnancy and their own smoking status|
|Figure 4|The associations of rs16969968 of UK Biobank women participants (G1) with their first child’s (G2) birthweight by their mothers’ (G0) and their own smoking status during pregnancy, after adjusting for the first 10 genetic principal components|
|Supplementary figure|The associations of rs16969968 with UK Biobank participants (G1) height and age at menarche in sensitivity analyses|
