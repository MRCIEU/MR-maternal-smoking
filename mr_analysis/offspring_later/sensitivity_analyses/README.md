## Sensitivity analyses
The only difference here comparing to the [main analyses](https://github.com/MRCIEU/MR-maternal-smoking/tree/master/mr_analysis/offspring_later) is we re-stratify participants based on their smoking status before the outcomes happen.

To run the code in R, use:

```
source ('height.R')
source ('menarche.R')
```
